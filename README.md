# NESGameAssembly

This is a WIP project in ASM that reecreates a Famicom game as it would be made at the time by a developer in Japan. It can be played on real hardware and works on all emulators. All the code is 100% mine except for the controller input routines.
This project has been quite significant for me as a developer, as I've been playing NES games since I was a child and always wanted to know how they were made. Additionally, it increased my understanding of machine code tenfold.

Build instructions:
  1. Download the repository files;
  2. Download NESASM (ca65 support coming later);
  3. Extract NESASM and the repository files and execute sfc.cmd;
  4. Open sfc.nes into any NES emulator.
